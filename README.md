# CFF-Ball-0x
CFF-Ball-0x is a code that simulates dense suspensions of rigid, spherical particles in a shear flow. The particles interact through hydrodynamics, contacts and conservative repulsive and attractive forces.

## About the code
CFF-Ball-0x is written in Fortran 95 and requires a fortran compatible compiler. The software comes with a Makefile that compiles the code through the `make` command (`make clean` to clean the compiled files).
The code is parallelised using the `OpenMP` library.
At the moment, the code can be compiled and run on a Unix (or Unix-like) environment.

## How to run the code
The code is simply run by typing in a terminal `./ball0x.exe` (the name of the executable file can be chosen in the Makefile) created post-compilation.
The parameters the code has to be fed with can be found in the self-explanatory file `p.in` (and `param.f90`).
The output file is written in `log.out`, where the current *time unit*, *relative viscosity*, *pressure* and several wall-time parameters are displayed.
The convergence of the simulation, instead, can be checked by plotting the quantities found into `checkConvergence.dat` (first column the *time unit*, other columns some quantities of interest; the second column, for instance, represents the non-normalised relative viscosity. The quantities written in that file can be found inside `timeIntegration.f90`).
